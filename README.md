# CARP
In this repository, you can find algorithms to solve the capacitated arc routing problem. This kind of problem deals with the question of how to make a circuit or a tour by visiting the arcs (and/or edges) in a graph. As an example, we can think about a city/town/neighborhood where we have the streets (arcs and/or edges) and their intersections (corners) represent the nodes. Therefore, if we must deliver good in some houses along the streets, we aim to minimize the total travelling distance. Furthermore, if we do this by walk, we can seemingly think that we can walk in any direction; but, if we do this by car, it is not that simple because there are two-way streets as well as one-way street. So, we can have directed graphs (one-way streets only), undirected graphs (two-way streets only) and mixed graphs (one-way and two-way streets together).
